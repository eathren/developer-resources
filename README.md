General Learning Resources
---


#### The Odin Project
 [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

The Odin Project is an open source, free learning resource that is top tier for learning some of the latest powerhouses that power the web right now. This is an excellent place to learn, and I've personally never seen a single individual who has said anything bad about it. 




Css and Sass
---
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, perhaps the only programming language with a name that actual gives information on what it does besides HTML. Sass supercharges css with mixins, variables (although vanilla css does now include variables), and imports. Overall, there isn't really a reason to NOT use sass. It just makes styling projects so much more convenient and enjoyable.

CSS Frameworks
---
**Material-UI**
My personal favorite, easy to use, easy to begin, powerful, included icons, and you can create themes. What's not to love?
[https://material-ui.com/](https://material-ui.com/)

**Material UI Themes and tools**
Use this site to pick the primary and secondary color, then copy the URL in the searchbar. We'll use this for the next link.
[https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0)

Paste the URL you got above into the provided field on this page
[https://react-theming.github.io/create-mui-theme/](https://react-theming.github.io/create-mui-theme/)

Boom, you have an instant color scheme for material-ui. Follow the instructions to wrap the theme around your project and then start to use it. Best part is, if you change your color scheme or anthing else in the future, it will automatically change all the appropriate items in your website/webapp. 




Javascript
---
**React**
A big dog of the frontend, it might be passed up by VUE here soon in terms of adoption. But while Vue.js is regarded as simpler and easier to pick up, React more than makes up in depth. However, I work primarily in React, so hey, maybe my opinion is biased. 

They also have a very well documented website for all kinds of features, and create-react-app is a great way to get all kinds of webapps off the ground quickly without having to fight against things like webpack and the like. 
[https://reactjs.org/](https://reactjs.org/)

**Fetching cheatsheet**
GET and POSTing data is pretty much the glue that holds the web together. JavaScripts native fetch() functionality is pretty great for that now, and has done wonders of decreasing the reliance developers had on AJAX.

Python
---
#### Django
Possibly the most popular python framework for webapps, I can not say enough good things about Django. Of all the frameworks and resources available, I feel that their documentation is simply the best, and that just makes life easy. 

I should note that perhaps the absolute best feature for Django is how damn easy it is to write tests. TDD is a treat that doesn't get to get exercised much for frontend projects, but for backend and/or API work, it just makes life so easy. 
[https://www.djangoproject.com/](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
[https://djangogirls.org/](https://djangogirls.org/)
	Django Girls is a learning resource aimed at, you guessed it, girls to learn django. It also is one of the, if not the, best resource of django information out there. 

#### Django Rest Framework
DRF is used to use Django as a rest framework, aka to use it to create a fully-fledged backend with authentication, database, serializations, and more. If you want to use a frontend seperate from what Django gives by itself, it is well-documented, maintained, and powerful. 

**Books for Django and DRF**

 - [Django For Beginnners](https://www.amazon.com/Django-Beginners-Build-websites-Python-ebook/dp/B079ZZLRRL)
 - [Django For Professionals](https://www.amazon.com/Django-Professionals-Production-websites-Python/dp/1081582162)
 - [Django For APIs](https://www.amazon.com/Django-APIs-Build-web-Python/dp/1093633948)
 

Markdown
---
#### Formatting Markdown Files
Advice, tips, and tricks from github, one of the cornerstones supporting the .md file standard.
[https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

**Unified**
The Unified project is really adding juice to what exactly markdown can do. There have been some incredibly projects I've lent a hand on that I didn't think were possible with markdown.

#### Remark
Remark makes markdown better. That's pretty much it, and it's a neat tool (especially with Gatsbyjs)
 [What is Remark?  ](https://remarkjs.com/#1)
[Remark Github Repo and Readme](https://github.com/gnab/remark)


#### StackEdit - Live editor

StackEdit is just a convenient place to write up markdown files for doing work exactly like how I'm doing making this list. Pleasant enough to be useful, but not critical by any means (Sorry stackedit).

Produtivity
---

Workflowy
[https://workflowy.com/](https://workflowy.com/)
Workflowy is just lovely. If there was one SaaS that I would label as simply perfect, it's this one.  It's set up as a dynamic list making app, but what it really does is set up a page for every bullet point with children. You can then edit those further bullet points or writing, and go as deep as you want, and it's just instant. Make them, adjust them, move them, it's really a treat for how simple and elegant a django webapp can be.

I'm probably not giving justice to it, so just try it out. I think they give 600 free writes a month, which should be plenty for just about everyone. 


General Resources
---
**Free For Dev**: A massive culmination of free resources for developers, including databases, tools, trials, and more. 
[https://free-for.dev/#/](https://free-for.dev/#/)

**Developer Roadmap**
A very well put together roadmap to showcase the skills  to succeed and thrive in development nowadays. 
[https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

**Programming Book Collections (and pdfs)**

 - [https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md)
 - [https://github.com/tpn/pdfs](https://github.com/tpn/pdfs)


**Communities**

 - **Reddit-based**

**CanIUse**: CanIUse shows whether how much an item or feature of a language is supported by modern browsers. Also the dissapointing reason why I still don't use css grid (Come on last 7% of the web population that have browsers that don't support grid, get your act together!)
[https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)

**Emmet & Cheatsheets**
Emmet is awesome. Use emmet. Perhaps with visual studio code, but pick whatever you want. Here are some emmet shorthand codes to cut out some of the menial typing of it all.
[https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)

Design
---
**Figma**
Figma makes it easy to make mockups of design before you need to do it. Great for hobby projects or simple mockups, but it has some power to it as well. Plus it's free.
[https://www.figma.com/](https://www.figma.com/)

**Design Tips**
I'm not a designer, so tips and tricks to make content look and feel better always good in my book. 

Find a cheap copy of Refactoring UI somewhere. It actually has really nice tips for modern web development. 
[https://refactoringui.com/book/](https://refactoringui.com/book/)

 - **StoryBook Design**
	 - [https://www.learnstorybook.com/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/introduction/](https://www.learnstorybook.com/design-systems-for-developers/react/en/introduction/)
 - **Design for non-designers**

**Color Picker**
Picking complementary colors can be hard, and this makes it pretty trivial, as long as you don't expect much complexity. 
[https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/)

**Another color wheel**
Because you can't have too many tools or options
[https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/)

**Color Palette Generator**
[https://mycolor.space/?hex=%233789B3&sub=1](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%233789B3&sub=1)

**Box Shadows**
This makes box shadows that you can copy paste. Pretty useful, but not perfect.
[https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow)

**Animated Gradients**
Say it with me. "Oooh. Pretty". You can set these as backgrounds, or pretty much anything you want with a little work.
[https://www.gradient-animator.com/](https://www.gradient-animator.com/)



Test Driven Development
---
TDD is awesome. Use it whenever you can. Tests can be frustrating to write, or take a while, but having an option to just run your tests from the command line to see if new changes broke anything (or everything) is pretty much as close to Nirvana that I've found in dev work.
